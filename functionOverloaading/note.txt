Things to remember before using Function overloading
Things to remember before using function overloading:

Ensure that the functions have the same name but different parameters.
Make sure the functions are in the same class or namespace.
Consider the order and type of parameters when defining overloaded functions.
Avoid ambiguous function overloads that could lead to compiler errors.
Understand that function overloading is resolved at compile time based on the parameters used.
Kotlinâ€™s function overloading feature empowers developers with the ability to define multiple functions with the same name,
 but different parameter lists, offering improved code readability, reusability, and flexibility.
